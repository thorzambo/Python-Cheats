Common Runtimes
# Before we delve into the multiple runtime cases, let’s see the different common runtimes a program could have. 
# Below is a list of common runtimes that run from fastest to slowest.

# Θ(1). 
This is constant runtime. This is the runtime when a program will always do the same thing regardless of the input. For instance, a program that only prints “hello, world” runs in Θ(1) because the program will always just print “hello, world”.

# Θ(log N). 
This is logarithmic runtime. You will see this runtime in search algorithms.

# Θ(N). 
This is linear runtime. You will often see this when you have to iterate through an entire dataset.

# Θ(N*logN). 
You will see this runtime in sorting algorithms.

# Θ(N2). 
This is an example of a polynomial runtime. You will see this runtime when you have to search through a two-dimensional dataset (like a matrix) or nested loops.

# Θ(2N). 
This is exponential runtime. You will often see this runtime in recursive algorithms (Don’t worry if you don’t know what that is yet!).

# Θ(N!). 
This is factorial runtime. You will often see this runtime when you have to generate all of the different permutations of something. For instance, a program that generates all the different ways to order the letters “abcd” would run in this runtime.
