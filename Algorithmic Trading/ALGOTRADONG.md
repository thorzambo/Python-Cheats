Algorithmic Trading Means using Computer to make Investment Decisions.
# In the Past: Analyzer Team
# Now: More Computers Than Humans

There are many different types of Algorithmic trading.
The main difference is their speed of execution.

Main Players in the Algorithmic trading Landscape:

# Renaissance Technologies $165B in AUM 50% | Year for 20 Years -> Founded by a Phd Student
# AQR Capital Management $61B in AUM
# Citadel Securities: $32B in AUM High Frequency Trading

AlgoTrading With Python:
Python is the #1 most popular language for algorithmic trading. Quantitative Finance.
+ A lot of libraries
- Python is slow
Solution: Is often used as Glow to trigger code that runs in other languages
Common Example: NumPy -> The most popular python Library for Performing numerical Computing
Although its written for use in Python, its underlying functionalities are written in C.

The Algorithmic Trading Process:
The Process of running a quantitative investing Strategy can be broken down into the following steps:
1. Collect Data
2. Develop a Hypothesis for a strategy
3. Backtest that strategy (Could work with past data?)
4. Implement the strategy in production (real money)

NOT COVERING: AKA CHECK: WORKS WITH REAL DATA? WORKS WITH REAL TRADES? WE WILL OUTPUT AN EXCEL DOCUMENT, ORDER SHEETS.
